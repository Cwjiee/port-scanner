# port-scanner

This ia an application that scans for ports to check and see which ones are ``Open`` or ``Closed``.
Port scanning is done by iterating every port on a machine. Currently, there's only TCP port scanning in this application.

Have used goroutines and channels to improve the performace of port scanning.

This application is built using Golang.
